# C++ program for managing car parts 

A project from the faculty in the 1st semester of the 2nd year at the course named ”Object Oriented Programming”.

## Requirements

1. Defining at least 5 classes related to the project requirement
2. Each class must contain at least one dynamically defined field managed by a pointer; both strings (char *) and numeric value vectors must be addressed
3. In the solution there must be at least one class that defines a static field and at least one class that defines a constant field
4. All attributes are defined on the private area of the class
5. A public interface is defined for each attribute (accessory functions); the modification functions must contain at least one rule for validating the received value
6. Each class contains at least 2 generic attributes processing / display methods
7. Each class contains at least 2 constructors with parameters, copy constructor, destructor and overloaded operator form =
8. For each class it is mandatory to overload >> and <<
9. For each class it is mandatory to overload:
   - indexing operator []
   - at least one mathematical operator (+, -, * or /)
   - ++ or -- (with 2 forms)
   - the cast operator (to any type) explicitly or implicitly
   - the operator for negation!
   - a conditional operator (<.>, = <,> =)
   - the operator for testing the equality between 2 objects ==

10. All classes are defined in a single source file
11. Class testing (main method) can be found at the end of this source file
12. A module is implemented through which the user can save the application data in binary files and in text files
13. The module is implemented through which the user has the possibility to generate different reports for the data within the application
14. A module is implemented to manage a simple form of menu through which the user has the possibility to navigate through the functions of the application (after starting the application, the user has the possibility to use numeric keys or to enter text to decide which functions to activate)
15. Implementing a class that exemplifies the concept of class composition
16. Extending already defined classes by adding new attributes and new functionalities
17. At least one abstract class is implemented (with or without attributes) that must contain at least 2 pure virtual methods
18. At least 2 virtual methods are implemented (other than pure virtual ones)
19. By means of the abstract class or a basic class (newly defined or existing) is defined at least a hierarchy that describes a family of classes;
20. 
At least one vector of pointers is implemented at the base class (of the hierarchy) through which concrete elements from a class family are managed (a class family is given by a set of classes based on derivation / inheritance relationships based on a common parent
21. Implement at least one vector, set, list, and map from the STL library to manage application data
